Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.

```
mkdir mykernel and cd mykernel and place the linux-x.xx.x here.

mkdir linux_kernel

tar xvf linux-* -C linux_kernel/ --strip-components=1

cd linux_kernel

cp /boot/config-$(uname -r) ./.config

sudo make -j$(nproc) deb-pkg

데비안 패키지 빌드에 필요한 인증키 를 요구하면 다음과 같이 커널 패키지 소스를 받아서 그 안의 키를 복사

```
sudo apt install -y linux-source 

cp -v /usr/src/linux-source-5.15.0/debian/*.pem debian/
